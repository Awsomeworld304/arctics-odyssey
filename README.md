A side scrolling, story packed, rhythm game.\
\
A high paced story-rhythm game featuring bosses and battles as you fight your way out.\
The rhythm aspect is focused in five key StepMania like gameplay, with songs that you play through while managing enemies in battle scenarios.\
The story revolves around an arctic fox.\
More story info is to be made available. (Don't want to spoil the story yet!)\
This project is quite ambitious and needs a lot more resources and work which needs to be worked out and planned accordingly.
